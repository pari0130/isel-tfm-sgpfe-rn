Nowadays, in institutional services (Banks, Portuguese Immigration and Borders Service, Embassies, Social Security and others), there is often a great time loss from customers due to long queues and/or delays when being attended to. With this project, a sistem that allows queue management and waiting time forecast was developed.
	
The system, to interact with an individual, has a mobile component that allows the taking of the serviceâ€™s tickets, having real time updates about the state of the queues of interest. When taking a ticket, the objective is to show the client of the system the information about the expected waiting time. A notification mechanism is used to notify an individual when his turn to be attended is approaching. With this, there is no longer the need to dislocate to retrieve tickets, allowing an individual to carry out other tasks outside the place he/she wishes to visit.
